This app combines the two ideas of pitch detection and soothing sounds for people with PTSD or stress problems. 
There will be around 5 or 4 soothing sounds, and the range of pitches will also be divided into 4. Each range of pitches will correlate to a soothing sound with a similar range of frequencies.
If you play or sing a pitch in that range of frequencies, the app will understand that and play the corresponding soothing sound for that range of frequencies.
